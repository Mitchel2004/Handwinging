# Handwinging

### Handwinging is a game where you play like an airplane. The goal is to fly an airplane through as many rings as you can by using a controller on your wrist. This can be quite a challenge because you need to keep your arm straight, otherwise the plane will start drifting the wrong way.

## How to play?

### Use the strap to fasten the controller around your wrist and turn it on. Then, connect the receiver to your computer and start up the game.
### By lifting and lowering your arm like a plane, your can go left and right. But make sure to not overdo it, because if your miss a ring, it's game over!
### If you want to go up or down, your have to rotate your arm forwards or backwards like the wings of the plane.
### In the top-left corner you can see how many rings you've passed through.
### The green LED on the receiver shows whether the receiver is getting a signal from the controller or not. If there is no signal for longer than 1 second, the game pauses itself until there is a connection again.

## What if the plane isn't moving?

### Try to reset or reconnect the receiver. Your computer might not recognize the receiver when the game is already loaded.
